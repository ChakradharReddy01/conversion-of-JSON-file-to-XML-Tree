In today's data-driven world, converting data between different formats is a common necessity. Here's a practical Python script that I recently worked on to convert JSON data into an XML format. This script efficiently handles different data types and structures, ensuring a smooth transition from JSON to XML.

Key Highlights:
ðŸ”¸ Versatility: The script handles various data types including dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.

ðŸ”¸ Dynamic Element Creation: Depending on the data type, it creates appropriate XML elements such as <object>, <array>, <string>, <number>, <boolean>, and <null>.

ðŸ”¸ Pretty Printing: Utilizes the minidom module to output well-indented and human-readable XML.
